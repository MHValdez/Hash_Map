# Hash_Map
Two hash map implementations that use different methods for collision resolution

- [OSU CS261 A6 - U22.pdf]() provides design specifications
- [a6_include.py]() provides helper classes
- [hash_map_sc.py]() handles collision with chaining using linked lists
- [hash_map_oa.py]() handles collision with open addressing via a quadratic probing scheme

*Both hash maps are written from skeleton code. Ctrl+F for comment "Begin student implementation" (without quotes) to see my work.*
